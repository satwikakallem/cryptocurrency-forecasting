🚀 Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

This project aims to predict cryptocurrency prices (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) using machine learning and deep learning models. The system leverages historical price data, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis (optional) to forecast short-term and long-term price trends.

📌 Features

-> Data collection from cryptocurrency APIs (e.g., CoinGecko, Binance, Yahoo Finance).
-> Preprocessing and feature engineering (technical indicators like RSI, MACD, Moving Averages).

Time-series modeling using:

-> LSTM / GRU models
-> Traditional ML regressors (Random Forest, XGBoost)
-> Baseline statistical models (ARIMA, Prophet)
-> Model evaluation with metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE.
-> Visualization of historical vs. predicted prices.
-> Option to deploy as a web app (Streamlit/Flask).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
Deep Learning: TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch
Time-Series: statsmodels, Prophet
Data Sources: Binance API / Yahoo Finance API
Deployment: Streamlit / Flask (optional)
